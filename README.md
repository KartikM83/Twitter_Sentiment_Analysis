# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of tweets using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, visualization using word clouds, and a sentiment classification model trained on a Twitter dataset.

## Project Description
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we analyze tweets to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral. The project includes the following components:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: We load a Twitter dataset from Kaggle and perform data cleaning by removing rows with missing text or sentiment labels.

2. Word Cloud Visualization: We create word clouds to visualize the most frequent words in positive, negative, and neutral tweets.

3. Sentiment Classification: We train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier using TF-IDF vectorization to predict the sentiment of tweets. The model is evaluated for accuracy and a classification report is generated.

4. Predicting Sentiment: We demonstrate how to use the trained model to predict sentiment for new tweets.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be found here: [Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset]((https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/twitter-tweets-sentiment-dataset)).

## Dependencies
To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python (>=3.6)
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- wordcloud
- matplotlib
  
You can install these packages using pip:

## Setup

1. Download the Twitter dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project directory.

2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned above.

## Usage

Ensure that you have followed the setup steps.

Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform sentiment analysis on the Twitter dataset.

You can modify the model for your specific needs or use it to predict sentiment for new tweets.

## Results

The project provides insights into sentiment analysis and includes visualizations of word clouds to highlight frequent words associated with different sentiments. The classification model's accuracy and a classification report are also presented.
